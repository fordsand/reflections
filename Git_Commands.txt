Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

git diff will do this. It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare. 


Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.

git clone will do this. It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy. 


Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.

git checkout will do this. It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore. 


Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

git log will do this. It doesn't take any arguments.

Behavior of git clone

If someone else gives you the location of their directory or repository, you can copy or clone it to your own computer.

This is true for both copying a directory and cloning a repository.

As you saw in the previous lesson, if you have a URL to a repository, you can copy it to your computer using git clone.

For copying a directory, you weren't expected to know this, but it is possible to copy a directory from one computer to another using the command scp, which stands for "secure copy". The name was chosen because the scp command lets you securely copy a directory from one computer to another. 


The history of changes to the directory or repository is copied.

This is true for cloning a repository, but not for copying a directory. The main reason to use git clone rather than copying the directory is because git clone will also copy the commit history of the repository. However, copying can be done on any directory, whereas git clone only works on a Git repository. 


If you make changes to the copied directory or cloned repository, the original will not change.

This is true for both copying a directory and cloning a repository. In both cases, you're making a copy that you can alter without changing the original. 


The state of every file in the directory or repository is copied.

This is true for both copying a directory and cloning a repository. In both cases, all the files are copied.

Behavior of git log

git log lists the most recent commit first, as you can verify by checking the commit dates. The middle commit probably contains the code for the mute button, since the commit message indicates that the mute button was added in that commit. The top commit also probably contain the mute button, since that commit is more recent and nothing suggests the mute button has been removed. The bottom commit probably does not contain the mute button, since that commit was created before the commit that added the mute button.

To summarize:

commit 7be5a12f1567866b0d77ccdf2055d1a33831da78 (the top commit listed)

Yes, probably contains the mute button.

commit 06d72e1f95f046002ec46f41cf71957227111141 (the middle commit listed)

Yes, probably contains the mute button.

commit 3d4d45b246aad6a1cd0afaf7cfae26966110727e (the bottom commit listed)

No, probably does not contain the mute button.

Behavior of git diff

The middle commit, 06d72e, is the first commit with the mute button, so comparing that commit and the previous commit, 3d4d45, would show the changes that add the mute button.

In order for the changes adding the mute button to be shown as additions, the commit with the mute button needs to be the second argument to git diff. That is because git diff considers the first argument as the "original", and the second argument as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first.

Thus, the last command listed, git diff 3d4d45 06d72e, is correct, and would show the mute button lines as additions. Reversing the arguments and running git diff 06d72e 3d4d45 would instead show the mute button lines as deletions.
